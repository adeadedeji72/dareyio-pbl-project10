# **LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS** #

It is also extremely important to ensure that connections to your Web solutions are secure and information is encrypted in transit – we will also cover connection
over secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol), its purpose and what is required to implement it.

When data is moving between a client (browser) and a Web Server over the Internet – it passes through multiple network devices and, if the data is not encrypted,
it can be relatively easy intercepted by someone who has access to the intermediate equipment. 
This kind of information security threat is called Man-In-The-Middle (MIMT) attack.

SSL and its newer version, TSL – is a security technology that protects connection from MITM attacks by creating an encrypted session between browser and
Web server. Here we will refer this family of cryptographic protocols as SSL/TLS – even though SSL was replaced by TLS, the term is still being widely used.

SSL/TLS uses digital certificates to identify and validate a Website. A browser reads the certificate issued by a Certificate Authority (CA)
to make sure that the website is registered in the CA so it can be trusted to establish a secured connection.

In this project, we will register your website with LetsEnrcypt Certificate Authority, to automate certificate issuance you will use a
shell client recommended by LetsEncrypt – cetrbot.

### **Task** ###
This project consists of two parts:

  1. Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer
  2. Register a new domain name and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates
Your target architecture will look like this:
